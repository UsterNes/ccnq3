* Applications code layout

  agents/     -- Any background agents; most of them monitor CouchDB _changes and
              -- act upon insertion / modification ..
  couchapps/  -- CouchApps (in CoffeeScript)
              -- Normally called "_design/${application}" with ${application} the name
              -- of the application (to avoid conflicts).
  node/       -- Zappa REST APIs
  scripts/    -- FreeSwitch (Lua) scripts
  conf/       -- FreeSwitch configuration fragments (examples)

  *.config files are actually JSON documents

* APIs

In most cases (except for the core portal) the application is driven from the
web browser. Therefor most applications will provide REST/JSON APIs only.

Moreover these are only provided for databases updates (where the node/ code
allows writer access without allowing reader access to the global CouchDB databases).
For databases read, the application is a couchapp or (equivalently) static client-side
HTML and Javascript, accessing the "source+prefix"-specific database directly.

* Central databases

The following central databases are available:
  _users        -- System-wide authentication and authorization
  provisioning  -- System-wide provisioning information (host, endpoint, location, number, ..)
  billing       -- System-wide billing information (account, ..)
  cdr           -- System-wide CDR repository

* Unified web access

The web access is unified as follows:

  - A unified website, such as https://example.net/ , is used for all applications;

  - The content in the subdirectories of "public" is available under the root:
      https://example.net/javascripts
      https://example.net/stylesheets
      https://example.net/images

  - The "portal" application must be accessible under /u/
      i.e.  https://example.net/u/path  is a proxy for  /path in the portal application
    (The application itself does not use the /u/ path, but multiple links in the application require it.)
    [FIXME This requirements could be lifted by adding proper configuration options to the portal application and agents.]

  - The global couchdb databases (_users,provisioning,..) and all the ${UUID} databases are mapped at the root.

  - CouchDB's _session is mapped at the root.
    [FIXME This assumes we can use a distributed session scheme in CouchDB which doesn't exist yet.]
    [For now this doesn't cause any issue as long as the website uses a single CouchDB host.]

  - Other applications (than the "portal" application) can be made available but their location can be chosen.

  - Other content is provided by the applications' user.
    CCNQ3 applications can all be loaded using (for example) jquery's getScript().

Such a unified URI space can be constructed using standard application mount points / reverse proxy in nginx, etc.
We present an example configuration for lighttp2 because nginx does currently not support reverse proxying IPv6 hosts, while lighttp2 (or apache2) does.
