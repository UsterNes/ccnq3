* Account identifiers are formatted as paths:

  /path1/path2/path3/path4

* The billing database references information about paths using records
  which IDs are:

    account:/path1/path2/path3/path4

* User roles contains (amongst other values) a list of

    account:/path1/path2

  prefixes.

* A database is created for each user-assigned prefix. The database thus
  created is made available (as readers) to users whose roles list that
  prefix.

  For example the database corresponding to the prefix  /path1/path2
  will be made accessible to users who have account:/path1/path2 listed
  in their roles.

  The database is named using a hash of (at least) the user-assigned
  prefix, in order to avoid issues due to enumerating the databases on
  the server.

* A single database is kept per-prefix. The master databases
  (provisioning, cdr, etc.) are replicated into those databases.
  Uniqueness of IDs is enforced by using "type:key" IDs. (Provisioning
  will contain types such as "number", "endpoint", "location"; CDR will
  contain the "cdr" type.)

  Since readers have write (modify) access to the database, a user could
  add comments, etc., on a private database, which would not replicate
  into the master.
