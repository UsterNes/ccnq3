= Record inbound tier in CDR =

We need new accounting for inbound calls so that we can record the inbound tier at the time the call record is created.

Proposed solution:
- inject account numbers (FQ, hence tiers) at the carrier-sbc (could also have routing done there in that case)
  Update: this is the accepted solution, the "account" field should be used to track for example inbound tier.
