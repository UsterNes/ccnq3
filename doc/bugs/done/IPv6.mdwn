1. Due to npm limitations and github/npmregistry not being available over IPv6, installation must use IPv4.
2. Due to Node.js URL parsing bug, use host names (DNS) instead of IPv6 IP Addresses for configuration of the system. [OBSOLETE]

#1 is outside our control, therefor not a bug, but a documentable limitation. A possible workaround would be to provide pre-compiled node_modules in the Debian packages.
#2 is actually a non-issue -- we now enforce the use of names and provide a database-driven DNS server.
