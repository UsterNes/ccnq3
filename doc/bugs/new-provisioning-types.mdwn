Q: What is the proper data model for application extensions?

Say, I want to add a new module that adds components to provisioning.
How do I add valid "provisioning_types" (from an external module)?

A: At least inside the deployment project (which could be the plain provisioning app or not) I need to have some registry of applicable types, which then gets included inside the user_push/user_pull functions.
