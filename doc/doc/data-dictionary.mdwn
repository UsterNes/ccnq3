This document is up-to-date as of 2011-10-27.

Notes:
- URI of databases = URI of CouchDB databases (always a string).
  These URIs might contain authentication usernames and passwords.


* provisioning records

  * host (aka config)

    _id: type+host
    account: ''    (the empty string)

    type:"host"
    host: string; hostname, preferably FQDN (must match what the "hostname" command returns)

    # Note: Changing any of these settings would require to restart the matching
    #       services, since configuration is read (in most cases) once at startup.

    admin:   (only present for bootstrap-system hosts normally; there's no reason to modify these)
      couchdb_uri: server admin URI
      system: true   (indicates this host is the one that should do system updates)

    applications: (string) list of applications that need to be installed
      Note: these are simply relative paths to the matching "package" for that application.
      Example:   [ "applications/host", "applications/traces", "applications/freeswitch" ]

    usercode:
      couchdb_uri: URI of the usercode database (with database admin authentication) [used by couchapps to install their applications]

    provisioning:
      couchdb_uri: URI of the provisioning database (with database admin authentication) [used by couchapps app]
      host_couchdb_uri: URI of the provisioning database (read-only) [allows access to the provisioning database from any host]

    install: (normally not defined)
      # This feature is used to force re-installation of the corresponding databases (for example to change the URI)
      usercode:
        couchdb_uri
      provisioning:
        couchdb_uri
      users:
        couchdb_uri

    # Specific to hosts running FreeSwitch.
    # "applications/freeswitch" must be included in the applications field.
    sip_domain_name:  string (required); FQDN accepted by the server
    rtp_ip: local IP to bind to for RTP [default: "auto"]
    sip_profiles: {} of profiles descriptions:

        sip_profiles[profile_name]:

          # Sofia data
          template: sofia template name (e.g. "sbc-media", "sbc-nomedia")
          # For the "sbc*" types, we need:
          ingress_sip_ip: which IP (v4,v6) to bind for ingress processing
          ingress_sip_port: which port to bind for ingress processing
          ingress_acl: [] of CIDR records "ip/masklen" source IPs allowed for ingress processing
          egress_sip_ip: which IP (v4,v6) to bind for egress processing [default: ingress_sip_ip]
          egress_sip_port: which port to bind for egress processing [default: 10000+ingress_sip_port]
          egress_acl: [] of CIDR records "ip/masklen" source IPs allowed for the egress processing

          # Dialplan data
          handler: dialplan template name (e.g. "client-sbc", "carrier-sbc")
          type: dialplan profile type (e.g. "usa", "usa-cnam", "fr" for processing="client-sbc")
          send_call_to: where to send the calls ("socket", "bridge") [default: "socket"]
          ingress_target: domain where to send ingress calls
          egress_target: domain where to send egress calls

      Notes: changes (except for *_sip_ip and *_sip_port) are automatically applied.

    sip_commands: {} of profiles commands:

        sip_commands[sofia_profile]: string
          One of:
            "start"       sofia profile <profile_name> start
            "restart"     sofia profile <profile_name> restart reloadxml  [required to change IP or port]
            "stop"        sofia profile <profile_name> killgw

        Note: All these commands will cause calls to drop if any is present on that profile.
        Note: The "sofia_profile" key is either "egress-#{profile_name}" or "ingress-#{profile_name}" so that each direction
              can be restart independently.
        Note: Add a command then remove it from the hash to prevent accidental misfiring of commands.
        Note: A special "sofia_profile" key "opensips" is used to send events to a running OpenSIPS process (rather than a
              FreeSwitch sofia profile). These events must follow the OpenSIPS "MI" syntax.

    sip_variables: {} of global (FreeSwitch) variables; defaults to {}
        Note: The idea is that these can be used on a per-host basis by additional dialplans, profiles, etc.

    # Specific to hosts running OpenSIPS.
    # "applications/opensips" must be included in the applications field
    opensips_proxy:
      port:34340   integer, required, do not change
      hostname:"127.0.0.1"   string, required, do not change
      usrloc_uri: URI of the location database (used to save registration data); for example "http://127.0.0.1:5984/location"

    opensips:
      model: "complete", or any other model defined in common/opensips [required]
      listen: [] of strings "host:port" to which OpenSIPS will bind()  [default is the empty array, in which case OpenSIPS binds to all interfaces on port 5060]

      local_ipv6: reserved

    sip_commands:
      opensips: string; command send to the OpenSIPS "MI" channel (must follow the MI syntax, including having \n between parameters).

    # Specific to hosts running the portal (or its back-end).

    portal:
      port: integer (8765)

    users:
      couchdb_uri: URI of the _users database (with database admin authentication)
      replicate_uri: URI for "/_replicate" (with database admin authentication)
      userdb_base_uri: base URI of the various users' databases (with server admin authentication, used to create the databases)
      public_userdb_base_uri: public base URI of the various users' databases (no authentication! given out to the users)
    mailer:     Used as the configuration for the node-mailer package.
      sendmail: "/usr/sbin/sendmail"
      SMTP: null
    mail_password:
      sender_local_part: "support"; The mail_password agent will send emails from  sender_local_part+"@"+domain (where domain is the user's record's "domain" field).

    Note: "host" records are referred to as the "config" record inside most applications.

    # Specific to hosts running SIP traces.
    # "applications/traces" must be included in the applications field
    traces:
      interfaces: [] of interfaces names
      # There's no reason to modify the following parameters for traces.
      filesize: integer, maximum size of the sniffer traces (in ko), defaults to 10000
      ringsize: integer, maximum number of sniffer trace files, defaults to 50
      workdir: string, directory used to store the traces, defaults to /opt/ccnq3/traces

  * domain

    _id: type+domain
    account: ''    (the empty string)

    type:"domain"

    # Outbound call routing
    dialog_timer: integer; maximum call (dialog) duration
    outbound_route: integer; route to use for outbound calls from this endpoint; if null, per-number outbound_route is used

    src_endpoint/allow_onnet
    src_endpoint/check_from
    src_endpoint/dest_domain
    src_endpoint/dialog_timer
    src_endpoint/disabled
    src_endpoint/endpoint

  * number

    _id: type+number
    account: string

    type:"number"
    number: string; the number as routed inside the system; note that this must be consistent end-to-end; normally the inbound- and outbound-proxies rely on "E.164-without-plus"; while the client-side servers might rely on locally-formatted numbers.

    # Outbound call routing
    outbound_route: integer; the outbound_route used if the endpoint has no outbound_route assigned
    location:  string; the location identifier for this specific number (used for emergency location services)

  * rule (aka outbound_route)

    _id: type+rule
    account: ''    (the empty string)

    ruleid: integer; a unique ID for this rule
    groupid: integer; the "outbound_route" identifier found in "endpoint" and "number" records
    prefix: string; the routing (number) prefix (might be ""), longest-prefix match
    timerec: string; a time specification
    priority: integer; ruleset ordering criteria (within the groupid and prefix, for matching timerecs, the rule with the highest priority is chosen)
    gwlist: string; a comma- and semicolon-separated list of gateways

    # The following fields are required even though they are not currently used.
    routeid: 0   (the integer 0)
    attrs: ""   (the empty string)

    Note: For the complete specification, see http://www.opensips.org/html/docs/modules/1.7.x/drouting.html#id293582
    Note: We use sort_order = 1, meaning that inside gwlist each semicolon delimits a group of gateways; each group contains a comma-delimited list of gateways. For each call, two gateways are selected at random in each group (groups are kept in the order they appear), and the call is then sequantially forked to each gateway.


  * gateway

    _id: type+gateway
    account: ''    (the empty string)

    type:"gateway"
    gateway: host+gwid
    host: the host on which OpenSIPS is running and using this gateway
    gwid: a unique identifier for the gateway on this host; used in the "gwlist" field of the "rule" record

    # The following fields are required even though they are not currently used.
    gwtype: 0   (the integer 0)

    # The following fields are required, and might be used at your convenience, although we only test the values shown here.
    probe_mode: 0
    strip: 0

    # The following fields are optional
    pri_prefix:  string
    description:  string

    Note: for probe_mode, the following modes are available:
      0: no probing
      1: probing only when disabled (however our scripts do not use dr_disable())
      2: probing at all times

  * location

    _id: type+location
    account: string

    type:"location"
    location:  string; a unique identifier for this location
    routing_data:  string; specific to the emergency routing system used


* _users records

  * user record

    _id:"org.couchdb.user:"+name
    type:"user"
    name:  string; the username

    salt:  string; a random string
    user_database:  string; the name of the user's own CouchDB instance
    roles: [] of string
    domain:  string; name of the domain used at registration time
    profile:
      name:  string; user's full name
      email:  string or array of strings; email or email addresses for this user

      userdb_base_uri:  base URI (to which the user_database is concatenated)
      user_name: name
      user_database: user_database

  Notes: This is a standard CouchDB _users record with some additions.
  Notes: The "profile" hash is returned by a GET /u/profile.json once logged-in.
  Notes: The "name" field is normally the user's main email address (at least that's what the registration code assumes); servers and applications will also have _users records so that they can remotely access the main database.
  Notes: Servers should have the "host" role assigned.
  Notes: The roles hash can also be manipulated using the REST API in applications/roles.

* usercode records

  This database should only contain design documents which are replicated into each user's private database when the user logs in.

* endpoint location records

  These record are read-only.

  * endpoint location

    _id: username+"@"+domain (registration username)
    username: string; username part of the registration username@domain
