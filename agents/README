These agents will track CouchDB's _changes and run applications based
on the changes.

Database: _users

  * send_email:
    Send confirmation email for users who requested registration.

  * track_roles:
    Create target databases for "account:" roles and each base database
      (if the target database does not already exist)
    Add the proper role as a reader on the target database
    Push the "-user.js" couchapp onto the target database
      This is mostly done so that the views are not implemented on the base database.
    Start replication between the base database and the target database
      using a filter to only replicate at or below the "account:" role.
