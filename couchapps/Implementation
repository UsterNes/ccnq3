* Account identifiers are formatted as paths:

  /path1/path2/path3/path4

* The billing database references information about paths using records
which IDs are:

  account:/path1/path2/path3/path4

* User roles contains (amongst other values) a list of

  account:/path1/path2

prefixes.

* A database is created for each base database (e.g. provisioning) and
user-assigned prefix combination. The database thus created is made
available (as readers) to users whose roles list that prefix.

For example databases

  provisioning$/path1/path2
  cdr$/path1/path2

will be made accessible to users who have account:/path1/path2 listed in
their roles.
