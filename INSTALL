- You will need a CouchDB database.
  This can be BigCouch, a proxy (look under etc/lighttpd2), or a regular database.
  It must be network-accessible from the local host (which is used to bootstrap installation) and from any other host in the system.
  Alternatively the bootstrap script can install CouchDB locally for you.

- All our script rely on sudo.
  Make sure sudo is available on every host, and that at least one user is able to use
  sudo with NOPASSWD.


- On the bootstrap host (the first host in the system), download this code

    cd && rm -rf ccnq3 && git clone git://stephane.shimaore.net/git/ccnq3.git && cd ccnq3

  then run

    ./bootstrap-system

  to make system adjustments, install CouchDB, and bootstrap the database.

  Alternatively, if you already have a CouchDB database system, use

    ./bootstrap-systems <URI>

  replacing the URI with your CouchDB installation's URI, including a system-level
  administrative account, such as: https://admin:password@cdb.example.net/
  In that later case, make sure your CouchDB installation has "require_valid_user = true".

- To register an additional host in the system, use the web interface.

- On any host you'd like to use in the system, download the code

    cd && rm -rf ccnq3 && git clone git://stephane.shimaore.net/git/ccnq3.git && cd ccnq3

  then run

    ./bootstrap-localhost <URI>

  where <URI> is the URI provided by the bootstrap-host script in the previous step.
