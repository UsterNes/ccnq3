- You will need a CouchDB database.
  This can be BigCouch, a proxy (look under etc/lighttpd2), or a plain CouchDB instance.
  It must be network-accessible from the local host (which is used to bootstrap installation) and from any other host in the system.
  (Using SSL is OK, and recommended.)
  Alternatively the bootstrap script can install CouchDB locally for you.

- All scripts rely on sudo.
  Make sure sudo is available on every host, and that at least one user is able to use
  sudo with NOPASSWD.


- On the bootstrap host (the first host in the system), download the code

    cd && rm -rf ccnq3 && git clone git://stephane.shimaore.net/git/ccnq3.git

  then run

    cd ~/ccnq3 && ./bootstrap-system

  to make system adjustments, install CouchDB, and bootstrap the database.

  Alternatively, if you already have a CouchDB database system, use

    cd ~/ccnq3 && ./bootstrap-system <URI>

  replacing the URI with your CouchDB installation's URI, including a system-level
  administrative account, such as: https://admin:password@cdb.example.net:5984/
  In that later case, make sure your CouchDB installation has "require_valid_user = true".

- To register an additional host in the system, use the web interface.

- On any host you'd like to use in the system, download the code

    cd && rm -rf ccnq3 && git clone git://stephane.shimaore.net/git/ccnq3.git

  then run

    cd ~/ccnq3 && ./bootstrap-localhost <URI>

  where <URI> is the URI provided by the web interface in the previous step.
