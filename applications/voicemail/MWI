* où sont-elles générées? on n'a pas d'agent sur les boîtes utilisateurs (user_db); le serveur de messagerie peut en envoyer directement au proxy à la fin de l'appel.
* qui traite les SUBSCRIBE?
  * OpenSIPS forwards SUBSCRIBEs to the notifier (so that the notifier can send a NOTIFY right back). Notifier sends NOTIFY to OpenSIPS which resolves as usual using usrloc.
* RFC3842, RFC3265
* Also implement unsollicited.
* Also multiple devices may match a single mailbox. So locate them based on the user_database.

* So we need: 
  * a generic "SIP light" subscribe-receiving/notify-sending library
    * subscribe-receiving needs to be able to do minimal parsing so that we can recover which user we're talking about, and able to send a well-formed 200 OK back
    * notify-sending needs to be able to send a notify message out and handle the response (or lack thereof) from the client.
  * notify sending is done from within applications/voicemail/node/messaging.coffee
  * notify-on-subscribe node server (configured as a subscribe-message-recipient on OpenSIPS)
  * unsollicited notify node server -- need to figure out how often, how we crawl the user databases list, etc.
