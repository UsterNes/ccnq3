MWI
* RFC3842, RFC3265
* Also implement unsollicited.
* Also multiple devices may match a single mailbox. So locate them based on the user_database.


    CPE    --- SUBSCRIBE ---> proxy ----(forward)---> notifier
           <-- 200 OK ---  (generated by proxy)

    CPE    <-- NOTIFY    ---- proxy   <------- notifier
           --- 200 OK --> (dropped by proxy)

* So we need: 
  * a generic "SIP light" subscribe-receiving/notify-sending library
    * subscribe-receiving needs to be able to do minimal parsing so that we can recover which user we're talking about, and able to send a well-formed 200 OK back
    * notify-sending needs to be able to send a notify message out and handle the response (or lack thereof) from the client.
  * notify sending is done from within applications/voicemail/node/messaging.coffee
  * notify-on-subscribe node server (configured as a subscribe-message-recipient on OpenSIPS)
  * unsollicited notify node server -- need to figure out how often, how we crawl the user databases list, etc.
