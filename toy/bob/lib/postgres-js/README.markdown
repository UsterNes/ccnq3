# PostgreSQL for Javascript

This library is a implementation of the PostgreSQL backend/frontend protocol in javascript.
It uses the node.js tcp and event libraries.  A javascript md5 library is included for servers that require md5 password hashing (this is default).

This is using the api from node-persistence and is used by sousaball.

See test.js for sample usage.
