Package: ccnq3-dns
Architecture: all
Depends: ccnq3, iptables
Conflicts: bind, bind9
Description: Allows the ccnq3_dns service to be available on port 53
  Install this package on a host that will be running ccnq3_dns,
  so that a redirection from port 53 to port 53053 is provided automatically.
  .
  Alternatively you may choose to implement your own iptables rules (or provide
  a different forwarding solution), for example because you want to run both
  inbound_enum and a caching DNS server (such as bind9) on a server; in that
  case you should not install this package. The ccnq3_dns service will
  still start, since it is part of the ccqn3 package.
