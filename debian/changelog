  * After migration of _design/registrant into the provisioning code, all that was left was creation and check of the local provisioning database. However this is handled by applications/host, so there is no need to duplicate it here.
  * Clarified that application/host is responsible for the management of `provisioning.local_couchdb_uri` and the associated database.
  * Corrected opensips syntax for db_url in registrant
  * Added opensips table version for registrant
  * Need datatypes for registrant.
  * registrant: ensure we have all the data we need.
  * Changed assignements for `rule` and `carrier`.
  * rules: Provide defaults for `timerec` and `priority`.

  * Registrant (ovh) needs IP, not hostname.
  * registrant: Corrected field name
  * We're actually not pushing coffeescript, and __indexOf is missing.
  * registrant: get the proper values from the host document, and retrieve them properly in the list!
  * doc: registrant.remote_ipv4 is not longer supported.

  * CDR-swiper: change location of backup cdr storage
  * CDR-swiper, doc: import example JSON CDR
  * CDR-swiper: initial code (#5)
  * It appears gwid's might be strings.
  * Removed 'doc/bugs'.

  * Second set of clean up
  * doc/upgrade: initial version
  * Properly format responses to opensips http module in all cases
  * cdr-cleaner: initial code (#4)
  * Not longer provide a default for `cdr_uri`
  * Added README.md
  * Made sure that no CDRs are generated (on the local disk!) if no `cdr_uri` is present.
  * cdr-cleaner: do not attempt to remove non-copied documents
  * Anything above 2s for T2 for internal/upstream servers is way too long.
  * doc/outbound routing
  * Changed CCNQ3-* headers to X-CCNQ3-* headers.
  * Actually collect requested headers in `ccnq_extra` and `ccnq_attrs` to unify API.
  * Ensure the operation doesn't generate invalid XML.
  * Clarified that `outbound_route` can be used for a global or a local number.
  * Simplify
  * Add `X-CCNQ3-Number-Domain` header at the client-sbc in order to allow multiple number domains per OpenSIPS client-side proxy.
  * Handle the new X-CCNQ3-Number-Domain header set by client-sbc.
  * Removed obsolete code.
  * Add support for per-endpoint `number_domain`.
  * Updated proxy `number_domain` documentation to reflect new role.
  * Added some troubleshooting data for line-side `number_domain` selection.
  * Provide a different email message for `do_not_record` users. (#27)
  * Rewrote options for `send_email_notifications`

  * opensips/zappa: fix pico API changes for .rev
  * opensips/zappa: OpenSIPS 1.8 changed the behavior for location updates.
  * userdb: do not remove a user-db even if no _users record point to it. The database might be used by other applications (such as voicemail).
  * couchdb_daemon: initial code
  * couch_daemon: manage through daemon. The original plan was to manage through CouchDB (os_daemon) but there might be issues during initial install with CouchDB not being able to start the server and I'd rather avoid those.
  * couch_daemon: made server executable
  * Added _ccnq3 to applications/web
  * Corrected path in couchdb config. CouchDB rewrites the path by removing the matching prefix, so we need to add it back.
  * Defaulted carrier flags to 0. Using the default order makes more sense, since the whole point of having these records is to allow per-host ordering of gateways so that a gateway on the same host is chosen first.
  * Do not emit invalid dns view records.
  * (Minimally) Protect against invalid view records.
  * do not crash on delete or insert..
  * Attempt to work around extraneous Route: headers (set e.g. by CSipSimple) which have ;lr and the local host
