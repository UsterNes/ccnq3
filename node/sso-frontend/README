The Single Sign-On front-end provides a user-oriented interface to:
- the authentication database(s)
- the session manager

It provides:
- registration (create and validate a new record in the authentication database)
- login (authenticate then create a new session)
- logout (delete a session)
- session status

The only public entry points are the URLs:

/login.js
  The Javascript module will use an empty id="login_container" DOM object to realize
  all operations related to sso-frontend.
  If a login operation succeeds, the client browser's current page is reloaded.

/login.html?callback=:url
  Same as above; if a login operation succeed, the client browser is redirected
  to the specified callback URL.
